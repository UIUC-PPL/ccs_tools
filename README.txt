This directory contains all Charm-specific Java code.
This includes things like debuggers, GUIs, etc.

.jar files and run scripts are in the bin/ directory.
Java source are in the charm/ directory. .class files
are instead into the classes/ directory.

By putting everything in one place, hopefully we 
can make our Java code easier to use and re-use.

For now, projections and projector are still in 
the tools/ directory.
